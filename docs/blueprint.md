# **App Name**: StoreMapper

## Core Features:

- Clustering Algorithm: Use a machine learning model to review store data from the CSV file and determine optimal clustering of 5-10 stores based on geographic proximity, identifying latitude and longitude.
- Interactive Map: Render an interactive map using store latitude and longitude data.
- Store Cluster Visualization: Display clustered stores as distinct visual layers on the map, each color-coded and optionally numbered to clarify nearby groups. Include popup/tooltips on each map pin to provide details from the CSV like the name and store type.
- CSV Data Input: File upload of store details via CSV file.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) for a professional and trustworthy feel, hinting at mapping and location services.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop for the map and data display.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF9800) to highlight store clusters and interactive elements on the map, providing a clear visual distinction.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Simple, recognizable icons to represent different store types on the map, such as a shopping cart for supermarkets and a lightning bolt for express stores.
- Map should take up the majority of the screen, with a sidebar or collapsible panel for data input and cluster controls.
- Subtle transitions when zooming in/out on the map and when displaying store information.
